# What would/should I do better?

1. Git - Commit More Regularly
   1. Per Page
   2. Per Store
   3. Per Component
2. Do more in the Redux Store
   1. GraphQL was fun but not sure how to utilize it with Redux
3. GraphQL
   1. Extract parts Fragments
   2. Extract into Separate Files then import
   3. See how to use the Generated Schema to make the queries self Type Defined (GraphQL Generator?)
4. TypeScript
   1. Extract Types into a Module folder
   2. Use Partial for the Queries
   3. Use Generic for the PaginationResilt
5. React Router
   1. Extract all Routes into a Object
   2. Use Filter into Map to sort and display them.
   3. Implement a 404
   4. See if there is XSS potential when pushing the `character/:name` as it goes to input (Should be handled by framework?).
6. Styles
   1. Look at how to style the components better
   2. Use the Material UI class style
   3. Maybe look at TailWind CSS (Really love it my other projects)
7. General
   1. Follow more React Guidelines - naming, structure, etc. (Currently following more Angular/Vue approach).
   2. Extract Pagination into a HOC maybe?
